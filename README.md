# TML BLOCKS - HUBSPOT

The HubSpot TML Blocks provides sales and marketing analytics liveboards and ad-hoc search capabilities. Data is extracted from HubSpot using the HubSpot APIâ€™s and staged in tables in SnowFlake (or other CDW). A series of views are used to transform the data. ThoughtSpot connects directly to the views using an Embrace connection.
